# Pay_Less_Attention_slides
During my internship with Mayo Clinic's Natural Language Processing group in Summer 2019, we had weekly tech discussions where group memebers present a state of the art research topic. 
This repository contains the slides of my presentation in one such discussion, discussing the paper  [" Pay less Attention using Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10430) by Facebook AI Research
